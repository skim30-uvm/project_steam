I wanted to create a dataset from scratch based around games on the Steam Store. Using data gathered from the Steam Store and SteamSpy APIs (https://nik-davis.github.io/posts/2019/steam-data-collection/), this dataset provides information about various aspects of games on the store, such as its genre and the estimated number of owners.

Gathered around May 2019, it contains most games on the store released prior to that date. Unreleased titles were removed as well as many non-games like software, though some may have slipped through.

Feel free to use this data however you wish. I created it to be used as part of my data science learning journey, tracking progress on my blog.

Most of all, I hope you enjoy exploring this data. It's my first big data science project, and I wanted to make it about something fun and interesting. Feedback and suggestions are more than welcome.
